            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am a Canadian plein air painter with a deep commitment to capturing the fleeting, ever-changing light
                and colour
                of the landscape. Working on small 5x7 inch panels in the field, I focus on observing and recording
                colour notes with precision and sensitivity. These studies often serve as the foundation for larger,
                more developed studio paintings.</p>

            <p>My process is rooted in direct observation—responding to the moment with honesty and clarity. Plein air
                painting presents many challenges, especially as light and atmosphere shift quickly. My naturally
                sensitive nature allows me to connect intimately
                with the landscape and translate that experience into paint.</p>

            <p>At its core, my work is about presence—being fully engaged with the environment and striving to express
                its truth through colour, form, and feeling.
